Plays a video and draws its frames as album art using the [Media Session API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Session_API).

This is used to play Bad Apple on the Dynamic Island on an iPhone 14 Pro... at 2fps.

(iOS 16.1 will introduce the ActivityKit Dynamic Island APIs that will enable playing full framerate video, but I don't have the beta yet)

To use:

- Play the video
- Put Safari into background
- Go to Control Center and start playing the video from there
- Go to the homescreen
